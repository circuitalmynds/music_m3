This year marks the tenth anniversary of my third album The Raven that Refused to Sing. Back then I was remixing the classic seventies music of progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Gentle Giant, and Jethro Tull on an almost daily basis, so my head being full of their music the album became a sort of homage to that style and era.  A somewhat nostalgic trip then, but one I’m still very proud of.  The album was recorded mostly live in the studio at East West in Los Angeles with my amazing band at the time; Adam Holzman, Nick Beggs, Guthrie Govan, Theo Travis and Marco Minneman, and engineered by the legendary Alan Parsons, who gave it a really golden sound.

The second song on the album Drive Home was based on an original story and characters created by artist Hajo Mueller, later adapted for a beautiful animated video by Jess Cope, which in turn was developed into the computer game The Last Day of June (released by 505 games). The song features a remarkable first take guitar solo by Guthrie. 

A new collaboration with Jess for my forthcoming album The Harmony Codex is in the works, which I can’t wait to share with you!  In the meantime enjoy a new improved version of the original Drive Home video, expertly remastered and visually improved for its tenth anniversary by colourist Mozart Gabriel.
